# EXAMPLE: 01-spaceship

This is a simple example to show the Boilerplace AS-IS. This is exactly the code you would get if you downloaded boilerplate from your own project in [Verold Studio](http://studio.verold.com). We include this here, because it's a fast and easy way for a developer to see how the Boilerplate is structured. You can [visit the project](http://studio.verold.com/projects/5145fdd0e810360200000342) for which this Boilerplate was generated. You'll see that this is a simple project, with a single 3D model.
